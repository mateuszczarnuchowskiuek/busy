  title     = {Advancing ESG and SDGs Goal 11: Enhanced YOLOv7-Based UAV Detection for Sustainable Transportation in Cities and Communities.},
  abstract  = {Environmental, social, and governance issues have gained
               significant prominence recently, particularly with a growing
               emphasis on environmental protection. In the realm of heightened
               environmental concerns, unmanned aerial vehicles have emerged as
               pivotal assets in addressing transportation challenges with a
               sustainable perspective. This study focuses on enhancing
               unmanned aerial vehicles' object detection proficiency within
               the realm of sustainable transportation. The proposed method
               refines the YOLOv7 E-ELAN model, tailored explicitly for traffic
               scenarios. Leveraging strides in deep learning and computer
               vision, the adapted model demonstrates enhancements in mean
               average precision, outperforming the original on the
               VisDrone2019 dataset. This approach, encompassing model
               component enhancements and refined loss functions, establishes
               an efficacious strategy for precise unmanned aerial vehicles
               object detection. This endeavor aligns seamlessly with
               environmental, social, and governance principles. Moreover, it
               contributes to the 11th Sustainable Development Goal by
               fostering secure urban spaces. As unmanned aerial vehicles have
               become integral to public safety and surveillance, enhancing
               detection algorithms cultivates safer environments for
               residents. Sustainable transport encompasses curbing traffic
               congestion and optimizing transportation systems, where unmanned
               aerial vehicle-based detection plays a pivotal role in managing
               traffic flow, thereby supporting extended Sustainable
               Development Goal 11 objectives. The efficient utilization of
               unmanned aerial vehicles in public transit significantly aids in
               reducing carbon footprints, corresponding to the ``Environmental
               Sustainability'' facet of Environmental, Social, and Governance
               principles.},
